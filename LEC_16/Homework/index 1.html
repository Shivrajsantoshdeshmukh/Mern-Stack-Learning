            <h2>Introduction To Java</h2>
            <p>Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language designed for building robust, platform-independent applications. It uses a "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, enabled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Popular for web, mobile, and enterprise development, Java is known for its simplicity, portability, and extensive libraries.</p>
            <h3>Features of Java</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Platform Independence: Java programs can run on any platform with a JVM, following the "write once, run anywhere" principle.</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented: Java is based on OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, promoting modular and reusable code.</li>
            <li>Robust and Secure: With strong memory management, exception handling, and a secure runtime environment, Java minimizes errors and vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Multithreading: Java supports concurrent programming, allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously for better performance.</li>
            <li>Rich API and Libraries: Java offers a wide range of built-in libraries for networking, database connectivity, GUI development, and more.</li>    
            </ul>   
            <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
            <pre style="background-color: aqua;">
                <code>
                
// Example of a simple Java program
       public class Main {
      // Main method: Entry point of the program
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print a message to the console
         System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
                </code> 
            </pre>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Class Declaration: Every Java program must have at least one class. The file name should match the class name.</li>
                    <li>Main Method: The entry point of any Java program where execution begins.</li>
                    <li>Statements: Java uses semicolons (;) to end statements.</li>
                    <li>Case Sensitivity: Java is case-sensitive (e.g., Main and main are different).</li>
                    <li>Curly Braces: Code blocks are enclosed in {}.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Introduction to Arrays</h2>
            <h3>What is an Array?</h3>
            
            <p>An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, which allows for efficient data management and manipulation.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Characteristics of Arrays</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Size: The size of an array is defined when it is created and cannot be changed.</li>
                <li>Indexed: Each element in an array is accessed using an index, which typically starts from 0.</li>
                <li>Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array must be of the same data type, such as integers, floats, or strings.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Arrays</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>One-Dimensional Arrays: A linear list of elements, where each element can be accessed by a single index</li>
                <li>Multi-Dimensional Arrays: Arrays with more than one dimension, commonly used for matrices and tables</li>
                <li>Dynamic Arrays: Arrays that can change size during program execution, typically implemented using data structures like lists.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Introduction to Trees</h2>
            <p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a single root node at the top, from which all other nodes branch out. Nodes can have zero or more child nodes, and each child node can further branch out into more nodes. Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as file systems or organizational structures.            </p>

                <li>Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node.</li>
                <li>AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees is at most one.</li>
                <li>Red-Black Tree: A balanced binary search tree with an additional property that ensures the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.</li>
                <li>N-ary Tree: A tree in which a node can have at most N children.</li>
            </ol>
